# Dog-Breed-Prediction-Streamlit
Creating an app to predict Dog Breed and deploy is using Streamlit 
#### 1.This project is a web-based Dog Breed Prediction App built using Streamlit, TensorFlow, and other Python libraries. It allows users to upload an image of a dog and predicts its breed using a pre-trained deep learning model.
#### 2. The app supports .png, .jpg, and .jpeg file formats, preprocesses the images by resizing them to (224, 224) and normalizing pixel values, and outputs predictions for three classes: Scottish Deerhound, Maltese Dog, and Bernese Mountain Dog.
#### 3. To run the app locally, install the required libraries (numpy, streamlit, opencv-python, tensorflow), save the code as dog_breed_app.py, and execute it using streamlit run dog_breed_app.py.
#### 4. For cloud execution on Google Colab, upload the files, install the dependencies, and use pyngrok to expose the app via a public URL.
#### 5. Ensure the model.h5 file is compatible with your TensorFlow version.
#### 6. This app features a user-friendly UI, real-time predictions, and automatic image preprocessing, making it a straightforward and efficient tool for dog breed identification.
